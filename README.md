## üå± About

I would like to share my (little) knowledge about getting started with chia plotting on ubuntu server (21.04).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This repository will help a novice Linux user quickly getting started with chia plotting on Ubuntu Server 21.04. Since i am just learning github - there will be hard codes parameters which you need to change to match your environment.

## üëå Step by step guide

* ‚¨áÔ∏è You need a fresh Ubuntu Server 21.04 installation with the SSH feature enabled. The following links will guide you through the download process, installation and on how to create a bootable USB stick:
  https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview
  https://releases.ubuntu.com/21.04/ubuntu-21.04-desktop-amd64.iso

* ‚ôø Once the Ubuntu Server is up and running, go to your development machine and connect to your new Ubuntu Server through SSH. For example:

  ```bash
  ssh your_user_name@your_servers_local_ip_address
  ```

- üèõÔ∏è To configure a local static ip address, please follow this link: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-20-04/

- üòÄ Now we are one step closer to start plotting on our server

- üìÅ Create a folder called chia in your home directory 

  ```bash
  cd ~
  mkdir chia && cd chia
  ```

- üîÑ Install a neat tool called `progress`, which will monitor system processes like `cp` `mv` `rsync` etc 

  ```bash
  sudo apt install progress
  ```

  üì∂ For example, to view file transfers in real time we execute

  ```bash
  progress -w
  ```

- üíΩ ‚õèÔ∏è MadMax chia plotter needs to be installed within the directory `chia` directory we created earlier (~/chia). Issue the commands below to install the MadMax chia plotter  

  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y libsodium-dev cmake g++ git build-essential
  # Checkout the source and install
  git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter.git 
  cd chia-plotter
  
  git submodule update --init
  ./make_devel.sh
  ./build/chia_plot --help`
  
  # Code is copied from https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter
  ```

* ‚è∞ A few moments later

* ü™Ñ Now it's time to download my magical program  

  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manprinsen/chia-plotting-on-ubuntu-server/main/program.py && sudo chmod 777 program.py
  ```

* ‚úã Before we run the program, we need to enter the a correct Pool Key and Farmer Key within the program.
  The variables `poolKey` and `farmerKey` will be found in the beginning of the file

  ```python
  sudo nano program.py
  # ==> below is example output from the file
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  ...
  poolKey = "enter your own key"
  farmerKey = "enter your own key"
  ...
  ```

  To save the changes simply execute the following key combination `ctrl + x` followed by `y (to save)` and hit  `enter`

* üöÄ To run the program, simply issue the following command

  ```bash
  ./program.py
  ```

  You will be greeted with the following screen

  ```python

  ```

* üôè I dont know it it's just be, but I have a hard time remembering a bunch of shell commands. So the main purpose  of this program is the handle this for you. 

  #### From now on you will only need to SELECT which task you want run, which, from my perspective, makes Ubuntu Server USER FRIENDLY!!

* üè≥Ô∏è I appreciate any feedback, especially feedback from Linux guru's
